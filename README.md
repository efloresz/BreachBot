# Breach Bot Project
 A Chatbot That Educates Users About the 2019 Facebook Data Breach. Created August 25, 2022

This program creates a chatbot that greets the user, asks if they want to learn about the 2019 Facebook data breach, and provides information about the breach upon request. The chatbot also offers its perspective on the breach, including its relation to the CIA Triad, its opinion on Facebook's response, and its advice for users who may be affected by the breach. 
# Purpose
* The purpose of this code is to create a simple chatbot that interacts with the user to provide information about the Facebook data breach that occurred in 2019. The chatbot asks the user if they would like to learn more about the breach and provides information on the details of the breach and the organization's response. Additionally, the chatbot offers its own perspective on the breach and provides advice to the user on how to protect themselves from potential security risks. The code aims to inform the user about the breach and provide them with actionable steps to take to protect their personal information.

# Project Requirements
* Basic Python programming: The program uses Python code to create a chatbot that interacts with the user.

* User input/output: The program prompts the user for input using the input() function and outputs messages to the user using the print() function.

* Variables and data types: The program uses variables to store and manipulate data, such as breachYear, userName, todaysYear, and timePassed. The program also converts data types, such as converting todaysYear from a string to an integer using the int() function.

* Control structures: The program uses control structures, such as the while loop and if-elif-else statements, to control the flow of the program based on user input.

* String manipulation: The program uses string manipulation techniques, such as concatenation using the + operator and converting integers to strings using the str() function, to create messages for the user.

* Cybersecurity knowledge: The program provides information on a real-world cybersecurity event, including details of the Facebook data breach, the organization's response, and the chatbot creator's advice for users.

* Critical thinking and problem solving: The program requires critical thinking and problem-solving skills to create a chatbot that interacts with the user and provides information on a complex cybersecurity event.
